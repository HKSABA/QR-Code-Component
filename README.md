<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap"
/>
```

```css
body {
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_fonts_google.asp) - This helped me to learn how to use Google fonts in my project. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested to learn the same because of its easy language, illustrative descriptions and meaningful examples.

- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.asp) - I have been able to understand the concept of box-shadow easily and thoroughly thanks to this page.
